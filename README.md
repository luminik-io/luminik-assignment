# AI Data Guardian Quest 🏰
## AI Engineer Assessment Project

Welcome, aspiring AI Guardian! Our data realm needs your expertise in building intelligent systems that can understand, analyze, and enhance data operations. This quest will test your abilities in AI engineering, specifically in applying AI/LLM technologies to structured data challenges.

## Quest Overview 🗺️

You'll create an AI-powered analysis system that helps analysts and researchers work more efficiently with structured data. Your system will analyze queries, provide insights, and enhance data exploration capabilities through AI!

### Environment Flexibility 🌐
- Use any SQL database of your choice (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.)
- Work with provided public datasets
- Implement using your preferred development environment

## The Three Challenges 🏆

### 1. The Query Whisperer 📜
Build an AI agent that can understand and optimize SQL queries.

**Requirements:**
- Create embeddings for SQL queries to understand patterns
- Implement similarity search to find related queries
- Build an LLM-based system that can:
  - Explain queries in natural language
  - Suggest query optimizations
  - Identify potential performance issues
  - Recommend better query structures

**Sample Data Provided:**
- Collection of SQL queries from Spider benchmark dataset
- Sample database schemas
- Query complexity metrics

### 2. The Data Detective 🔍
Create an AI system that helps analyze and understand customer behavior patterns using the e-commerce public dataset.

**Requirements:**
- Build an AI agent that can:
  - Answer natural language questions about customer behavior
  - Identify interesting patterns and anomalies
  - Generate insightful visualizations based on verbal requests
  - Provide automated data analysis reports
- Implement RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for accurate insights

**Dataset:**
- [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)
- Features order data, customer reviews, product categories
- Rich structured data with temporal and categorical information

### 3. The Insights Oracle 🎯
Create an AI assistant for the NYC Taxi Dataset that helps analyze urban mobility patterns.

**Requirements:**
- Develop an LLM-powered natural language interface that can:
  - Answer complex questions about travel patterns
  - Generate and explain insights about urban mobility
  - Create dynamic visualizations based on natural language requests
  - Predict busy areas and times
- Implement semantic search for similar patterns

**Dataset:**
- [NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission Trip Record Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)
- Features pickup/dropoff locations, times, fares
- Rich temporal and spatial data

## Technical Requirements 🧰

### Core Requirements
1. **AI/LLM Implementation**
   - Use of modern LLM technologies (e.g., OpenAI API, Hugging Face models)
   - Vector embeddings for similarity search
   - Prompt engineering with structured data
   - RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) implementation

2. **Data Handling**
   - SQL query parsing and analysis
   - Structured data processing
   - Metrics calculation and analysis
   - Data visualization

3. **System Design**
   - Modular architecture
   - API endpoints
   - Proper error handling
   - Scalable design patterns
